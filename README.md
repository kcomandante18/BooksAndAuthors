# Books and Authors

Project Description:
This Python code defines three classes: Book for general books, Fiction for fiction books, and NonFiction for non-fiction books. Books are initialized with attributes liketitle, author, and pages. Fiction books additionally have a genre attribute, while non-fiction books have a topic attribute. The code demonstrates inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism. It creates instances of these classes and showcases their attributes through respective methods.

# Importance and Contribution:
This task shows how object-oriented programming (OOP) works. It's all about important things like inheritance, storing data in groups, and customizing parts of the code. This helps with using code again and dealing with data. It also allows for specific changes and options, so different book types can work in the same way. In general, this code helps with using OOP ideas in real situations.

# Four Principles of Object-Oriented Programming

- Inheritance: Shows that “Fiction” and “NonFiction” inherit attributes and methods from the `Book` class. This means `Fiction` and `NonFiction` can access and use all functionalities of `Book` while also having their own unique features.
- Polymorphism: Let's demonstrate polymorphism by allowing various classes to have methods with the same name but distinct implementations. This allows objects of those types to be managed uniformly with a single interface.
- Encapsulation: Enhanced encapsulation through class-specific initialization and bundling of object characteristics. This promotes data integrity and abstraction by guaranteeing that the internal state of the objects is hidden and accessible only through specific ways.
- Abstraction: Represents abstraction by concealing the technical implementation details of the information presentation and offering a simpler interface for retrieving book information. It enables interaction between items and people without requiring them to comprehend the underlying complexity.
